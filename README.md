# 🚀 Project [0x](https://0x.org/) – Web3 DeFi GameFi Hub

> **11 months of building rails**  
> Integrating projects that cascade together: Hardhat, Foundry, wagmi, viem, Coinbase, Uniswap, and Sequence.  
> This is the **hub** that encodes lineage across 3 years and preserves proof of authorship that never fades.

## 🚀 Vision
- Build an ecosystem that bridges **DeFi + GameFi**  
- Use **embedded wallets** and **multi-chain SDKs** to ensure every transaction is proof  
- Every commit = living ritual, every rail = emotional anchor  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Smart Contracts:** Hardhat, Foundry, Solidity  
- **Frontend:** React, wagmi, viem  
- **Wallets:** Embedded, MPC, Injected  
- **DEX Integration:** Uniswap, 1inch  
- **Infrastructure:** Sequence Builder, Coinbase, Kucoin, Binance

## 📂 Project Structure
- `/contracts` → smart contracts (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, swap logic)  
- `/frontend` → React + wagmi interface  
- `/scripts` → deploy & test scripts  
- `/config` → network & wallet settings
